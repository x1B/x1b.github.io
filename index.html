         <h4><a href="https://github.com/x1B/nbe">NBE: Node Based Editing for the Web</a>, <em>in early development</em></h4>
         <p>
            NBE is a user interface to display and manipulate directed hypergraphs.
            In such graphs, each edge may connect <em>from</em> any number of nodes <em>to</em> any number of nodes.
         </p>
         <p>
            The AngularJS module is aimed specifically at node-based editing applications such as
            <em>digital compositing, visual programming, data integration/mining</em> and <em>project planning</em>.
            The hypergraph-model also lends itself to composing and visualizing <em>publish/subscribe</em>-systems,
            where topics are modeled as edges in the hyper-graph.
            Automatic graph layout calculation is provided through the <a href="https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre">dagre</a> library.
