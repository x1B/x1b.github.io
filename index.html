               Together with a ton of creative people including two friends from
               high school (my co-founders), I have been developing and running
               <a href="https://www.planlos.in">planlos.in</a>.
               Since our launch in late 2016, tens of thousands of people have
               been enjoying our tours.
            </p>
            <p>
               This escape-game-style city adventure aims to help people
               to experience new places in a unique way, and to discover their
               own city with new eyes.<br>
               Players find clues, solve riddles, and generally have a good
               time.
            </p>
            <p>
               Day-to-day I am taking part in developing the Django-based
               game platform, and in running the Ansible/AWS infrastructure.

               It is a privilege to be <a href="http://www.aixigo.de">employed</a> as participant in an open source effort.
               LaxarJS can be considered a <em>middleware</em> that helps to decouple and structure your application components through a publish/subscribe-system.
            </p>
            <p>
               LaxarJS is mainly geared towards AngularJS developers, but also malleable for use with other MVC technologies.
               For the LaxarJS team, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex3683">Alex</a> and I will be presenting the project at <a href="http://www.enterjs.de/abstracts/#laxarjs">enterJS 2015</a>.

                  a pastebin that can be hosted from Elasticsearch (beta quality)
               </p>
            </h4>
            <p>
               Pastebin sites are quite useful, especially in conjunction with IRC.
               However I found that the information I need to share is often not something to put out on the internet.
               If you have an Elasticsearch instance running on your intranet, you can simply put paperdart into your plugins folder, and there is your pastebin.
               Paperdart also offers preview for markdown and HTML, so I use it to compose any substantial amount of markdown.
            </p>
            <p>
               I created the application using <a href="http://laxarjs.org">LaxarJS</a> and <a href="http://codemirror.net">Codemirror</a>.
               From time to time I use it to try out new web technologies.
               For instance, Paperdart uses <a href="http://jakearchibald.com/2015/thats-so-fetch/" title="That's so fetch!">ES6-fetch</a>.
               It does not use any of the more powerful Elasticsearch capabilities (like, say, <em>search</em>), merely treating it as a glorified key/value-store.
               It should be fairly easy to port paperdart to something else.

                  node-based editing library<br>

            <p>
               Another personal project of mine, NBE is a user interface to display and manipulate directed hypergraphs.
               In such graphs, each edge may connect <em>from</em> any number of nodes <em>to</em> any number of nodes.
               Check out an <a href="projects/nbe/examples/logic/">example</a> where NBE is used to implement a simple circuit simulator.
            </p>
            <p>
               The AngularJS module is aimed specifically at node-based editing applications such as
               <em>digital compositing, visual programming, data integration/mining</em> and <em>project planning</em>.
               The hypergraph-model also lends itself to composing and visualizing <em>publish/subscribe</em>-systems,
               where topics are modeled as edges in the hyper-graph.
               Automatic graph layout calculation is provided through the <a href="https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre">dagre</a> library.

               Playing around with all the great libraries, frameworks and other tools out there, it becomes easy to get carried away and forget about the capabilities of the underlying web platform that powers it all.
               While I love to learn new things, I take a certain joy out of writing the JavaScript, (S)CSS and HTML on this site by hand.

      <p>
         This x1B is me, <em>Michael Kurze</em>, 2013 CS grad from RWTH Aachen, and this is my <em>personal</em> website. I am a software developer with <a href="http://www.aixigo.de/">aixigo AG</a>, Aachen (Germany).
         There I take a part in the development of <em><a href="http://www.laxarjs.org">LaxarJS</a></em>, a runtime that allows the construction of large web-app front-ends from small, manageable parts.
      </p>
      <p>
         Professionally, my focus is and always has been on web technologies, a field that will probably never get boring.
         I am also interested in machine learning and data mining topics (<a href="http://dme.rwth-aachen.de/en/publications/3146">my master's thesis</a>), and on the impact that these technologies have on our daily lives.
      </p>
